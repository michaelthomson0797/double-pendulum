# double-pendulum
A basic simple pendulum simulation in the terminal written in C using ncurses. Lines are drawn on a grid using bresenham lines. Includes a single and double pendulum.

## Compilation
Run the make command and run either the single or double pendulum simulation
```
make
./double
./single
```

Press Ctrl+C to quit

## Customize
Edit the variables defined in the EDIT THESE sections of the double_pendulum.c
or single_pendulum.c file. Here you can adjust the gravity and damping
coefficent of the simulation, as well as the mass, length, and initial angle of
the pendulums
